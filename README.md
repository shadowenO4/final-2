# Travel App

## Project Overview
The Travel App is a comprehensive travel planning tool that helps users gather essential information about their travel destinations. It integrates with multiple APIs to provide:
- Location details from Geonames
- Weather forecasts from Weatherbit
- Location images from Pixabay

The app is built using modern web technologies:
- Frontend: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Build Tools: Webpack
- Testing: Jest
- Offline Support: Workbox service workers

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shadowenO4/final-2.git
   cd travel-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up API keys:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     GEONAMES_USERNAME=shadowenO4
     WEATHERBIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
     PIXABAY_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage
1. Enter a location in the search field
2. Select your travel dates
3. View the following information:
   - Location details (country, region, timezone)
   - 16-day weather forecast
   - Location images
4. Use the app offline - cached data will be available when offline
